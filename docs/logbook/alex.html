		<h2>PHASE 1</h2>
		
		<h3>May,7/2018</h3>

			<p>
			•	First day of classes for semester 6<br/>
			•	Run down of elevator project for this semester given by profs (Ali, Mike)<br/>
			•	“30 000 foot view” – 5 microcontrollers that each are used for a specific function of the elevator<br/>
				o	3 controllers for the floors (copies of each other with slightly varied ins / outs)<br/>
				o	1 controller for the elevator itself (activate lights, choose floor, etc)<br/>
				o	1 controller for motor control and floor location. This is supplied, no motor control code needed, just control from supervisor with instructions.<br/>
			•	Chose group partners (Jeff English, Mike Wright)<br/>

			•	Attempted to use Git / GitHub for the first time. Will take some getting used to.<br/>
			•	Downloaded GitKraken on Linux laptop (Linux desktop version). So far the terminal is more understandable.<br/>
